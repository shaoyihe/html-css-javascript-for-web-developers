                Your site is very simple. It consists of a page heading and 3 sections
                (all in one row in the
                desktop view).
                Each section contains some text. You can make it dummy text/”lorem ipsum”, it doesn’t matter. How the
                sections
                are
                laid out on the screen depends on the width of the browser window. (Hint: use media queries discussed in
                Lecture

                desktop, tablet, and
                mobile. The browser
                should display a desktop version of the site when the width of the browser window is 992px and above.
                Tablet
                view
                should appear only if the width of the browser window is between 768px and 991px, inclusively. Mobile
                view
                should
                appear only if the width of the browser is equal to or less than 767px.
